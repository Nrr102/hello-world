# hello-world
My first repository
Hello everyone,
This is my first time using GitHub and I am exicted to embark on this journey! I am beginning to learn the basics of Python and am using PyCharm as my IDE. I am a consulant in San Diego and I use Microsoft Excel for almost all of my work. So, for some of my work I use Excel VBA, which is the source of where I became interested in learning to code.
